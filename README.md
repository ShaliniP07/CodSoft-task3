## Password generator in Python programming Language
## Author: Shalini P
## Batch: (1 November- 30 November,2023)
## Domain: Python Programming
## Aim: To build a password generator
## Description/Working of code:
1. The password_generation function takes a number as input, which represents the desired length of the randomly generated password.

2. Inside the function, a string called characters is defined, which contains all the possible characters that can be included in the password.

3. An empty string called password is initialized to store the generated password.

4. The function then uses a for loop to generate a random character from the characters string for the specified number of times. Each randomly generated character is appended to the password string.

5. After the loop has completed its execution, the password_generation function returns the generated password.

6. The main part of the program takes a number as input from the user and calls the password_generation function with this number as argument.

7. The generated password is then printed to the console.

8. The program will continue to run until the user inputs a non-positive number when asked for the desired length of the password.
